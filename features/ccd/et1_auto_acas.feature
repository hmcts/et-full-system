Feature:
  As a CCD
  I want to ensure that all fields are mapped correctly in CCD
  So civil servant can triage an employees claim against their employer

  Scenario: A claim with a valid acas certificate attaches the certificate to the claim
    Given an employee making a claim wanting to be contacted by 'post'
    When the completed form is submitted
    Then the claim should be present in CCD with an attached acas certificate
